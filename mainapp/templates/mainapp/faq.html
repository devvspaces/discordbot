Click \'Open\'.<br>Now you are in the DM panel where you can send out your order.<br>First of all you will need a good message, a good message is for example:<br>\'Join us! Our pump server has big gains / giveaways / fair pumps\'<br>NOT something like \'hey, join my pump server thanks.\'<br>A good message impacts the amount of people who will join from your invites.<br>Second of all, enter your target server, this is the server which you would like to DM advertise in. and after its finished parsing, click connect!<br>Third, add your preferred blacklist. This isnt required but if you would like to exclude your server users from being messaged for example then its pretty helpful.<br>There are multiple other options aswell. \'Stop after ___ Messages\' is if you would like to stop after a set amount of messages.<br>\'Add Users as Friend\' adds a messaged user as a friend.<br>\'Add Repeat Users to Blacklist\' adds a user which has been messaged to your active blacklist.<br>\'Delay\' From 15s-60s the higher it is the less chance the bots will have of failing.<br>And you\'re done! you can send out messages :)');">Sending Messages</button>
